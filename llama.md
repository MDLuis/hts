# Example of how it asks questions


## First batch of questions:


Based on the provided information, here are my observations and clarifying questions for each pillar:


1. Where it is from (source or origin):
   - The text does not mention the country of origin of the silk fabrics. Clarifying questions:
     - Is the silk fabric a product of a specific country?
     - Is it a blend of silk from different countries?


2. How it is made (composition or process):
   - The text mentions that the silk fabric is from Chapter 50: Silk, specifically HTSNO 5007.10, which refers to fabrics of noil silk. However, it does not provide information on the manufacturing process or the type of silk fibers used (e.g., wild silk, mulberry silk). Clarifying questions:
     - Is the silk fabric processed in any way (e.g., woven, knitted, treated with chemicals)?
     - Are the silk fibers obtained from a specific type of silkworm or a blend of different types?


3. What it is used for (purpose or application):
   - The text does not provide information on the intended use of the silk fabrics. Clarifying questions:

The answer to this was the following: `It is from China, it is woven. it is intended for clothing`

# Test #1

## Query: Silk fabrics
**Processing Time:** Around 10-15 min per batch answered (This test had a total of 4 batches + the initial query)

Based on the additional information provided, I can now make a confident classification.

The silk fabric is:

* From China
* 100% silk
* Woven
* Used for a scarf
* Weighs around 4-5 ounces
* For everyday wear
* Approximately 60-80 inches long and 6-12 inches wide

With this information, I would classify the silk fabric as a scarf, which falls under the chapter for articles of apparel and clothing accessories, not knitted or crocheted (Chapter 62).

More specifically, the scarf would fall under the subheading for scarves and neckwear (Heading 6213).

Please note that this classification is based on the information provided and may be subject to change if additional information is discovered.

# Test #2


## Query: Silk fabrics
**Processing Time:** Around 10-20 min per batch answered (This test had a total of 5 batches + initial)


Based on the additional information, here are my reflections and clarifying questions:


1. Where it is from (source or origin):
   - The silk fabric is Chinese-made silk. This information is sufficient to make a confident classification.


2. How it is made (composition or process):
   - The silk fabric is woven using a modern weaving process. This information is sufficient to make a confident classification.


3. What it is used for (purpose or application):
   - The silk fabric is intended for outerwear jackets designed for winter, as a single piece. This information is sufficient to make a confident classification.


Considering the fabric is Chinese-made silk, woven using a modern process, and intended for winter outerwear jackets as a single piece, I believe I have sufficient information to make a confident classification.


However, I would like to confirm that I have considered all relevant factors. To ensure accuracy, I would like to ask:


- Are the jackets designed to be worn with a specific type of clothing or layering system (e.g., base layers, insulating layers, accessories)?
- Are the jackets designed to be worn with a specific type of footwear (e.g., boots, shoes, sandals)?


If I have considered all relevant factors and still have doubts, I may need to
