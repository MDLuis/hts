This note mentions "Textile fabrics, felt and felt-lined woven fabrics, coated, covered or laminated with rubber, leather or other material, of a kind used for card clothing, and similar fabrics of a kind used for other purposes."

However, the note that specifically mentions silk fabrics is not present in the provided notes. But, the note for Chapter 50 (Silk) has a score of 0.837, which indicates a high relevance.

## Query: Medicaments containing antibiotics
**Processing Time:** 485.27 seconds

Based on the provided notes and tariff table rows, the HTS code that best matches the query "Medicaments containing antibiotics" is:

HTSNO 3003.20.00.00

This code falls under Chapter 30: Pharmaceutical products, and the note associated with this chapter states that it contains medicaments or other products of chapter 30. The specific tariff table row HTSNO 3003.20.00.00 has a score of 0.769, indicating a high relevance to the query.

The reason why HTSNO 3003.20.00.00 is the best match is that it specifically mentions "containing antibiotics" in the tariff description. This is a clear indication that the code is intended for medicaments that contain antibiotics, which aligns with the query.

The other relevant tariff table rows, such as HTSNO 3003.90.00.00, do not specifically mention "containing antibiotics" and therefore do not match the query as closely as HTSNO 3003.20.00.00.

## Query: Meat of bovine animals
**Processing Time:** 596.08 seconds

Based on the provided notes and tariff table rows, the HTS code that best matches the query "Meat of bovine animals" is HTSNO 0210.20.00.00.

The reason for this classification is as follows:

- The query specifically mentions "bovine animals", which refers to cattle.
- The relevant notes indicate that meat of mammals of heading 0106 (heading 0208 or 0210) should be classified under Chapter 3 (Fish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates), but since the query specifically mentions "bovine animals", it falls under Chapter 2 (Meat and edible meat offal).
- The top relevant tariff table row HTSNO 0210.20.00.00 directly corresponds to the query, as it specifies "Meat of bovine animals".

Therefore, the HTS code HTSNO 0210.20.00.00 is the most accurate classification for the query "Meat of bovine animals".
