# Benchmarks â€“ HTS Embedding Encoding

This file records how long the embedding process takes on the available hardware.  
All embeddings were generated with [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net) using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.

## Notes

- All times measured with `time.time()` before and after `model.encode()`.
- Batch size: 32
